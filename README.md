RetroPie-profiles-facebook-login
================================
### RetroPie-profiles Login Server using Facebook Login

This is a Login Server for the [RetroPie-profiles][profiles] plugin
backed by Facebook Login. So you can log in to your RetroPie with
your Facebook profile, which a lot of people are already logged in
to on their mobile devices.

Note that this _does not_ save your files on Facebook or in the cloud
in any way. However, you can easily set that up yourself using
something like `sshfs` for an SSH server, or maybe `s3fs` for storing save files
on Amazon S3.


Deploy
------

The first step is to determine which URL will enter for the Login Server
URL on RetroPie-profiles, as well as the URL that you will visit on your
mobile device to log in. This can either be a (sub)domain that you own, or a
free subdomain from `.now.sh` (so for example `https://nates-login-server.now.sh`).

See the [Zeit "alias" page](https://zeit.co/world#2.-alias-your-deployments) for
more details on deploying with a custom domain name.

Now that you've picked a URL, you can easily deploy your own instance without
even cloning the code:

1. Go to the [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) page and create a new "app".
1. Make sure to enable "Facebook Login", and _add the **OAuth redirect URI**_,
   which MUST be `<deployment URL>/callback`
1. [Download `now`](https://zeit.co/download).
1. Run the following command. Be sure to replace the three variables with their
   proper values from the Facebook App page!

    ```bash
    $ now TooTallNate/retropie-profiles-facebook-login \
        -e FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=<client id> \
        -e FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret> \
        -e FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI=<redirect URI>
    ```

1. You will get a new URL for the deployment. Copy that and use it in the
   `alias` command like so:

    ```bash
    $ now alias <unique deployment URL> <login server URL>
    ```

Now when RetroPie-profiles prompts you for the Login Server URL, entry the
callback URL that has been set up.
